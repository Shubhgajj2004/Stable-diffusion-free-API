# Stable-diffusion-free-API
Welcome to our open-source project on GitHub! I am excited to introduce with my simple code with the help of you no longer have to pay exorbitant fees to generate beautiful images. Many websites charge high prices for this service, which is understandable as generating images requires a significant amount of computational power. However, I have conducted extensive research and have not been able to find any free option for unlimited and give API services. 

In my code I have used two APIs, first api for MagicPrompt, a feature that helps users generate well-written descriptions with ease. All you have to do is provide a topic, and MagicPrompt will do the rest. and second api to generate an image.

This Api services are free to use I hope that these tools will save you time and money, and make your projects even more successful.

# Guide
The above code is ready for use, with only one final step remaining. Goto https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens 
copy the token and pase it in above code.

That's it. You are ready to use. No restriction, no limit. Generate unlimited images without prior knowlege of how to write the prompt.

# Example
input = "Man body with head of bear"

you will see generated output= "Man body with head of bear hybrid wearing polished armor character, beautiful face, by ilya kuvshinov, by thomas lawrence, by bayard wu, trending on artstation, masterpiece"

Thanks to MagicPrompt.


Thank you for choosing my project, and I hope you find it useful and enjoyable to use."
